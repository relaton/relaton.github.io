These bibliographic models are developed to consolidate and standardize
the data models used for bibliographic and citation purposes.

The Relaton information models are defined on GitHub:

* https://github.com/relaton/relaton-models


These models are meant to be fully compatible with the latest edition of
https://www.iso.org/standard/72642.html[ISO 690:2021] and ISO TC
46â€™s (and SC 4, SC 9) work on bibliography.

== Citation Model

A citation in Relaton consists of the following components:

* An identifier `bibitemid` for the cited source. This identifier corresponds to the identifier (`id`) of
a Relaton record describing the cited source.
* An optional date, in ISO 8601 format. This date is not intended for disambiguation, since `bibitemid`
already identifies the source unambiguously; it is added for ease of processing, in case author-date
citations cannot straightforwardly extract the date from the bibliographic source.
* A specification of the locality or localities in the source being cited.

A locality is a hierarchical specification of a location in a source. It is specified as a sequence
of named components of the source, each hierarchically refining its predecessor, from greater to smaller:

* `type` is the component of the source being specified; in the Relaton grammar, there is a sequence of
predefined types, and a user-specified type can be added with the prefix `locality:`. The predefined types are:

** `whole` (i.e. entire document)
** `section`
** `clause`
** `part`
** `paragraph`
** `chapter`
** `page`
** `table`
** `annex`
** `figure`
** `note`
** `list`
** `example`
** `volume`
** `issue`
** `time`
** `anchor` (for HTML pages)

* `referenceFrom` specifies the instance of the source component being cited; or, if a range of components is being
cited, the beginning of the range.

* `referenceTo` specified the end of the range, if a range of components is being cited. A range is only expected as the last (most granular) element in a hierarchical sequence of components.

So for example, the hierarchical specification "Part IV, Chapter 3, Paragraphs 22-24" is cited as:

[source,xml]
----
<locality type="part"><referenceFrom>IV</referenceFrom></locality>
<locality type="chapter"><referenceFrom>3</referenceFrom></locality>
<locality type="paragraph">
  <referenceFrom>22</referenceFrom>
  <referenceTo>22</referenceTo>
</locality>
----

NOTE: if the type of the component is `whole`, no `referenceFrom` or `referenceTo` is given.

=== Discontinuous citations

If two localities occurs in sequence, and have the same type, then they are interpreted as being a discontinuous reference. So "`pp. 32, 57, 99`" can be specified as:

[source,xml]
----
<locality type="page"><referenceFrom>32</referenceFrom></locality>
<locality type="page"><referenceFrom>57</referenceFrom></locality>
<locality type="page"><referenceFrom>99</referenceFrom></locality>
----

Alternatively, a sequence of discontinuous references can be specified through the `localityStack` element.
Each `localityStack` consists of a hierarchical sequence of `locality` elements, as above; a sequence of
`locality` elements can thus be treated as a single `localityStack`, with the `localityStack` wrapper left out.

So for example, the hierarchical specification "`Part IV, Chapter 3, Paragraphs 22-24; Part VII, Chapter 2, Paragraph 130`" is cited as:

[source,xml]
----
<localityStack>
  <locality type="part"><referenceFrom>IV</referenceFrom></locality>
  <locality type="chapter"><referenceFrom>3</referenceFrom></locality>
  <locality type="paragraph">
    <referenceFrom>22</referenceFrom>
    <referenceTo>22</referenceTo>
  </locality>
</localityStack>
<localityStack>
  <locality type="part"><referenceFrom>VII</referenceFrom></locality>
  <locality type="chapter"><referenceFrom>2</referenceFrom></locality>
  <locality type="chapter"><referenceFrom>130</referenceFrom></locality>
</localityStack>

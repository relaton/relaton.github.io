description: Categories of place and date of publication and publisher in Relaton

[[production]]
== Production

=== General

* Source: ISO 690, 4.6
* Serialisation: `bibitem/place, bibitem/contributor[role@type = "publisher"], bibitem/date`


=== Place

Strictly speaking the place of production
is an attribute of the publisher, and it can in fact be modelled as
`bibitem/contributor[role@type = "publisher"]/organization/address/city`.

However, it is modelled as a top-level attribute of the bibliographic item
to allow the place to be extracted by consumers of the serialisation more readily,
to allow multiple locations to be associated with the publisher, and to allow
only one of the places of the publisher to be associated with the production of the item.

A URI in a geographical registry may optionally be given as `place/@uri`.
A region within which the place is located may be given as `place/@region`,
for disambiguation purposes; using a ISO 3166 code for a country or subnational
region is recommended.

=== Publisher

The publisher is a subclass of creator (link:../creator[Creator]).

ISO 690, 4.1 differentiates between
"`publisher, online information provider, production company`" and
"`distributor, online host`".

Of the classes of creator that can be used as the publisher,
"`publisher or production company`" and "`printer or manufacturer`" have
`bibitem/contributor/role@type = "publisher"`;
"`distributor or issuing body`" and "`sponsoring body`" have
`bibitem/contributor/role@type = "distributor"`.

ISO 690, 4.6 allows that distributors, issuers and sponsors
can be named in addition to publishers.

Any restrictions on access to a resource imposed by an online host
(e.g. geographical restrictions) should be indicated in `bibitem/note`.

[[date]]
=== Date

For a point date, only `date/on` is populated. For a date range, `date/from`
and `date/to` are populated. If the range is ongoing,
the `date/to` element is left out.

The date for `date/on`, `date/from` and `date/to` is by default given as a
Gregorian date/time, following the conventions
of ISO 8601; in an XML serialisation, they would be expected to follow
the XML Schema `xs:datetime` representation (https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/[see here]).

However bibliographic
dates often contain information that cannot be restricted to an ISO 8601 date
(dates in other calendars, date corrections; other subdivisions of the year;
approximate date or no date.)

For that reason, the
model allows dates to be expressed in text instead of as an ISO 8601 date
(`date/on@text`, `date/from@text`, `date/to@text`), or as well as an ISO 8601
date if a Gregorian date is still applicable.

If the textual value of a date is a date range, and ISO 8601
dates are still to be provided for the start and end of the date range, then
the textual value is repeated for `date/from@text` and `date/to@text`.

Date corrections may also involve indications of provenance.

The date of copyright is associated expressly with the copyright holder, in
`bibitem/copyright/date/from`. Unlike other bibliographic dates, the copyright
date can only have a year value.

[[datetypes]]
==== Bibliographic date types

Dates are associated with specific phases of the production of a bibliographic
item, and those phases are named through `date@type`.

===== Common dates

The default type used in bibliography
is the date of publication (`date[@type = "published"]`), but the "`created`",
"`updated`", "`unchanged`", and "`copied`" dates in particular
are often given where they differ from the date of publication.

The date of transmission is used instead of the date of publication
for a broadcast.

created:: Date a resource was created. (If there have been multiple versions or editions, this
date applies to the first version.)
published:: Date a resource was published (distributed by the publisher).
accessed:: Date a resource was last accessed by the bibliographer; routinely used
for online publications. (Unlike in ISO 690, no distinction is made between
"viewed" and "accessed" based on whether the resource is human-readable or
machine-readable.)
updated:: Date a resource was updated and republished. Used for new versions and editions.
corrected:: Date a resource was corrected and republished. Used for new versions of documents,
in cases where the correction is not considered to amount to a new edition of the document.
(This is a subjective distinction made by the publisher.)
unchanged:: Date a resource was reprinted, i.e. republished without any changes.
circulated:: Date a draft version of a resource was circulated. Drafts by definition
are not published, so `circulated` is used instead of `published` for draft resources.
(For standards, this is associated with the latest transition to
a formally defined preparation stage, such as Working Draft or Committee Draft.)
transmitted:: Date a resource was broadcast.
copied:: Date a resource was physically copied, or recreated without any substantial
change in content (allowing for change in medium).
adapted:: Date a resource was adapted for a new purpose or audience, with some change
in content (includes translation).
announced:: Date that the existence of the resource was made public knowledge;
applies whether the resource has already been created or not, and whether it is to be
published or not.

The date of publication is taken to be the date when the current version of the resource
was published, unless a separate "`unchanged`", "`updated`" or "`copied`" date is given;
in that case, the date of publication is assumed to be the date of initial publication.

The date of creation is taken to apply to the work instantiated by the resource,
rather than to a specific format or edition. The latter are represented by the date
of adaptation and of update, respectively.


===== Dates pertaining to standards

The repertoire of date types is expanded to deal with the particular requirements
of standards shown below.

implemented:: Date a standard takes effect, becomes active.
obsoleted:: Date a standard becomes no longer in effect, was revoked.
confirmed:: Date a standard is renewed to take effect by an issuing authority.
issued:: Date a standard is authorised for publication.
vote-started:: Date the vote for a draft of the standard started.
vote-ended:: Date the vote for a draft of the standard ended.
stable_until:: The document is guaranteed not to be changed or updated until this date.
